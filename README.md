# PyTorch - Zero to Mastery Course Notes

This repository contains my personal code and notes from completing the **"PyTorch for Deep Learning"** course (50+ hours) by [Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-pytorch/). It covers foundational and advanced topics in PyTorch, structured across 5 chapters and 8 hands-on Colab notebooks.
